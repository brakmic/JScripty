### JScripty

A simple REPL-like utility for transpiling & executing ES6 code.

<del>Inspired by</del> Stolen from the excellent [esbox](https://github.com/callumlocke/esbox)
written by [Callum Locke](https://twitter.com/callumlocke).

**Beware**: This project is not intended to be used for anything productive!

It's a moving target and will likely change very soon.

I'm __only using it to learn__ ECMAScript 6, React & Redux.

#### Installation

```
npm install jscripty
```

#### Running

Open two consoles.

If you're running under Windows I recommend [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/).

In the first console open *test/file.js* with your preferred editor.

In the second console run the REPL by executing

```
npm start
```

Now edit the file and save it to kick-off the transpile-process in the REPL.

After a few moments your code will be executed and shown in the REPL.
